# ActionScript 3 Trace Statements Not Appearing

This repository contains a simple ActionScript 3 project demonstrating a common issue where `trace` statements do not appear in the output panel of the Flash IDE or an ActionScript 3 runtime environment like Adobe AIR.

## Bug Description

The `trace` function is a fundamental tool for debugging ActionScript code.  However, under certain circumstances, trace statements might fail to display any output. This can lead to difficulties in identifying and resolving issues.

## Solution

The solution might involve checking several things:

* **Output Panel Visibility:** Make sure that the Output panel in the Flash IDE (or the equivalent in your chosen environment) is open and visible. 
* **Runtime Configuration:** Verify the settings of your runtime environment. Incorrect configurations might suppress trace output.
* **Incorrect Context:** The trace statement might be within a part of the code that never executes, or within an incorrect scope or context.
* **Compiler Options:** Review any compiler options or build configurations that might affect debugging features.
